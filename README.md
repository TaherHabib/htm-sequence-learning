# Implicit Acquisition of Simple Reber Grammar in a Neocortex-inspired Neural Network
(Master's Thesis Code Repository)

Numenta's [Hierarchical Temporal Memory model (2016)](https://numenta.com/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/why-neurons-have-thousands-of-synapses-theory-of-sequence-memory-in-neocortex/) is used on the problem domain of Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL). Benchmarks used from AGL are: learning Simple Reber Grammar (SRG) transition rules; and, learning Embedded Reber Grammar (ERG) transition rules.

A detailed explanation of the project with the underlying motivation can be found in the presentation slides PDF file above.
