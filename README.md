# working-memory-model
A model of Working Memory based on Numenta's HTM that implicitly learns both short-term and long-term dependencies in the input stream. 

The used problem domain is Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL). Benchmarks used from AGL are: learning Simple Reber Grammar (SRG) transition rules; and, learning Embedded Reber Grammar (ERG) transition rules.
